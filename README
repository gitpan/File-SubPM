NAME
    File::SubPM - Obsolete. Superceded by "File::Where" 1.16.

SYNOPSIS
     use File::SubPM

     @sub_modules   = File::SubPM->sub_modules($base_file, @dirs);
     $module        = File::SubPM-->is_module($module, @modules);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is obsolete and superceded by the "File::Where" 1.16.

SUBROUTINES
  is_module method

     $driver = File::SubPM->is_module($module, @repositories)

    The "is_module" subroutine determines if a *$module* is present in a
    list of modules "@modules". The detemination is case insensitive and
    only the leading characters are needed.

  sub_modules method

     @sub_modules = File::SubPM->sub_modules($base_file, @dirs)

    Returns a list of modules in the directory defined by "$base_file",
    "@dirs".

REQUIREMENTS
    The "File::SubPM" subroutines shall be replaced by the appropriate
    "File::Where" subroutine whenever a "File::PM2File" subroutine needs a
    revision as follows:

     File::SubPM->is_module()                    File::Where->is_module()
     File::SubPM->sub_modules($base_file, @dir)  File::Where->program_modules($base_file,'',@dirs)

1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification

    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview

    The system is the Perl programming language software. As established by
    the Perl referenced documents, program modules, such the "File::SubPM"
    module, extend the Perl language.

    Many times sub program modules are placed in a sub directory. The
    methods in the "File::SubPM" module find all the modules in a sub
    directory and perform other processing of sub module names.

  1.3 Document overview.

    This document releases File::SubPM version 0.05 providing a description
    of the inventory, installation instructions and other information
    necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes

    Changes are as follows:

    Test-TestUtil-0.01
        Originated

    Test-TestUtil-0.02
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil....Bareword "fspec_dirs" not allowed while
        "strict subs" in use at

          /net/sunu991/disc1/.cpanplus/5.8.0/build/Test-TestUtil-0.01/blib/lib/Test/TestUtil.pm line 56.

        Changed line 56 from

         my @dirs = (fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        to

         my @dirs = ($fspec_dirs) ? $from_package->splitdir( $fspec_dirs ) : ();

        This error is troublesome since the test passed on my system using
        Active Perl under Microsoft NT. It should never have passed. This
        error is in a core method, *fspec2fspec*, that changes file
        specifications from one operating system to another operating
        system. This method has been in service unchanged for some time.

    Test-TestUtil-0.03
        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> test run

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/perl/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM"

        got: '$VAR1 = ''; ' (t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t at line 540 fail
        #17) # Expected: '$VAR1 = '\\=head1 Title Page

        The *pm2datah* method is not returning any data for Test 18. This
        will also cause the test of *pm2data*, test 19 to fail. The
        *pm2datah* is searching for the string "\n__DATA__\n".

        The "\n" character on Perl is a logical end of line character
        sequence. The "\n" end of line is different on Mr. Smokehouse's Unix
        operating system than on my Windows NT operating system. The test
        file was created under MSWin32 and uses a MSWin32 "\n". Under UNIX,
        *pm2datah* method will look for the Unix "\n" and there will not be
        any.

        Changed "\n__DATA__\n" to /[\012\015]__DATA__/.

        During the clean-up for CPAN, broke the *format_hash_table* method
        for tables in hash of hash format. Fixed the break, added test 29 to
        the *t/Test/TestUtil/TestUtil.t* test script for this feature, and
        added a discusssion of this feature in POD discription for
        *format_hash_table*

    Test-TestUtil-0.04
        item our old friend visits again - DOS and UNIX text file
        incompatibility

        This impacts other modules. We have to examine all modules for this
        portability defect and correct any found defects.

        Correct failure from Josts Smokehouse"
        <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> and Kingpin
        <mthurn@carbon> test runs.

        On Mr. Smokehouse's run email the got: VAR1 clearly showed extra
        white space line that is not present in the expected: VAR1. In Mr.
        Kingpin's run the got: VAR1 and expected: VAR1 look visually the
        same. However, the Unix found a difference(s) and failed the test.

        For Mr. Smokehouse's run:

        PERL_DL_NONLAZY=1 /usr/local/bin/perl "-MExtUtils::Command::MM" "-e"
        "test_harness(0, 'blib/lib', 'blib/arch')"

        What we have before, was a totally "failure to communicate." aka
        Cool Hand Luke. VAR1 was empty. Now VAR1 has something. It is not
        completely dead. One probable cause is the Unix operating system
        must be producing two Unix \012 new lines for a Microsoft single
        newline \015\012. Without being able to examine the test with a
        debugger, the only way to verify this is to provide the fix and see
        if the problem goes away when this great group of testers try for
        the fourth time.

        Revised *fin* method to take a handle, change *pm2datah* method
        handle, *$fh*, to binary by adding a *binmode $fh* statement, and
        pass the actual thru the *fin* method for test 18.

        Use *fin($fh)* to read in the data for *pm2data*, test 19 Unit Under
        Test (UUT), instead of using the raw file handle.

        The *fin* method takes any \015\012 combination and changes it into
        the logical Perl new line, *"\n"*, for the current operating system.

            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away all the file related methods from Test::TestUtil and
            created this module File::FileUtil so the module name is more
            descriptive of the methods within the module.

        *   Broke the smart nl code out of the fin method and made it is own
            separate method, smart_nl method.

            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: Perl, as Perl
            already does smart newline handling, (even though with the
            advent of 5.8 even Unix-people have to learn the word "binmode"
            now :-))

            The only place where I see Perl does smart newline handling is
            the crlf IO displine introduce in Perl 5.6. The File::FileUtil
            has a use 5.001 so that 5.6 Perl built-ins cannot be used. Added
            comment to smart_nl that for users with 5.6 Perl that it may be
            better to use the built-in crlf IO discipline.

        *   For the load_package method that uses a eval "require $package"
            to load the package, the $@ does not capture all the warnings
            and error messages, at least not with ActiveState Perl. Added
            code the captures also the warnings, by temporaily reassigning
            $SIG(__WARN__), and added these to the $@ error messages.

        *   Added two new tests to verify the NOGO paths for the for the
            load_package method. One tests for load module failure looking
            for all the possilbe information on why the module did not load.
            The other verifies that the vocabulary is present after the
            loading the module. This information is very helpful when you
            must remote debug a load failure from CPAN testing whose is
            running on a different platform.

    File-FileUtil-0.02
        Added the method *hex_dump*.

    File-FileUtil-0.03
        test_lib2inc
            Returns to parent directory of the first t directory going up
            from the test script instead of the t directory.

        find_t_roots
            Added the function find_t_roots that returns the parent
            directory of all the directories in @INC

    File-SubPM-0.01
        Removed the methods for converting a program module specification to
        its absolute file from the "File::FileUtil" module to their own
        module "File::SubPM" module. The module name is now more descriptive
        of the routines in the module.

    File-SubPM-0.02
    File-SubPM-0.03
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    File-SubPM-0.03
        Added the 'Data-Secs2' to the 'tlib' test library. Upgraded to the
        'Test-Tech' module that uses the 'Data-Secs2' module.

    File-SubPM-0.04
        The lastest build of Test::STDmaker expects the test library in the
        same directory as the test script. Coordiated with the lastest
        Test::STDmaker by moving the test library from tlib to t/File, the
        same directory as the test script and deleting the test library
        File::TestPath program module.

        Obsoleted this package by moving the subroutines to the
        "File::Where" program module and changing the interface slightly.
        This program module is now gutted and keep it around for a while for
        to support the transition to "File::Where"

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors

    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the module POD.
